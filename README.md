# None of It  

All of it should have been dropped, things should have been let go. None of what remained after, for there are no facts after the deeds but 
scant evidence and narration, should have been reviewed and judged. But that did happened. That continues to happen. The Tudors did not fully 
defend, and the Goths continued their torture. And as a result, some people really do have to die. 

What is deliberate and full in intention, so unyielding, cannot be tragedy. The tragedy comes after, when profiteers make money from the story, 
moralists build following by sharing the wisdom, and institutions build monuments to correct their wrongs. And as a result, people still become 
sick, hurt, and die.
