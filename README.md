# None of It  

All of it should have been dropped, things should have been let go. None of what remained after, for there are no facts after the deeds but 
scant evidence and narration, should have been reviewed and judged. But that did happened. That continues to happen. The Tudors did not fully 
defend, and the Goths continued their torture. And as a result, some people really do have to die. 

What is deliberate and full in intention, so unyielding, cannot be tragedy. The tragedy comes after, when profiteers make money from the story, 
moralists build following by sharing the wisdom, and institutions build monuments to correct collective wrongs. And as a result, people still become 
sick, hurt, and die.  

This here says that what was done so deliberately, full in intention, unyielding through the metaphysics of doubt and uncertainty, cannot be 
tragedy. This here leaves the responsibility to fate, the means and the ends, through to every finale. To witness such terrible losses, or 
to hear and read about them, and to call those things tragedies is common. It is because the audience relates those losses to themselves, putting 
themselves in the tragicadii's shoes. That is where one kind of empathy begins, and two kinds of madnesses follow: one, the madness of entertaining 
alternatives, and two, the madness of preferring intervention. There is, from a sequential and fully rational viewpoint, no life but the audience's own 
life, yet to tell this to some of them would be interpreted by them as abrasive and apathetic. And yet, so passionate some of the audience members are. 
And they indulge in the implications of the story they call tragic. They spread the word on what wrongs were in it and the greater goods that should have, 
could have, should have been. 

The transpirations that occurred that made the subjects lose would have had to have taken place, looking in hindsight. This fact itself is an insult when 
phrased in certain ways because it is so obvious and unhelpful: looking back, everything that had occurred would have had to occur because there are the 
laws of physics, the social construct, social contracts, and allegiances here and there that drove life, including human life, to act in those ways in 
those physical circumstances, partly constructed by mankind. 

Until after the unfortunate facts, and then to call what occurred tragedy is what third parties do. And bear in mind, these third parties do not have to 
be foreign. They can speak the same language, be of the same ethnic lineage, yet the third party chose to stay out. They chose to stay out of the way of 
the subjects of the so-called tragedy. If they had intervened or were resistance, antagonists of different colors in other words, then the losses suffered 
by the subjects of the so-called tragedy would mean the success of their objective. This principle is not always the case, too simplistic for the nuances 
of some matters, but in black-and-white terms a success of antagonist objective. The third party that chose to stay out maintains neutrality in alliance. 
Yet they are at liberty of stating so factually, and when questioned can argue their points even more, that what occurred is tragedy. They might take it a 
step further and state that what occurred was tragedy, meaning that there were losses and signs of lack of goodness, far from ideal, that the subjects of 
the plotline should have recognized during that timespan, thereby allowing them to steer clear from the events that transpired and thus prevent tragedy to hit. 

What is tragedy, then? Is tragedy really merely a genre of narration, and as such, not really intrinsically anything outside of facts smeared into these 
retellings that implicitly steer the audiences' preferences towards alternatives, better routes for them now that they have that wisdom granted to them? 
The law of nature and the law of human beings married once humans discovered civilization, albeit the marriage is a forced marriage not simply because 
humanity needs more and wants to control more. Humanity, of the ambitious kind, wants to need more at others' expense. This kind also wants to control more 
at others' expense. Marriage. An institution necessary to stabilize every human generation for the next. This is an important point to make because many 
tragic tales fixate on the idea of forced love and wanted love. Marriage is relevant in these situations. Yet, the institution is quite truly rotting in different 
ways in every subsequent generation. But it survives every time, because marriage is an institution to couple human beings, and it would be human beings that 
first die from illness or accident or war, first.
